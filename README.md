### Introduction
Personal portfolio 1 contains the code for my very first portfolio website made in 2019. This portfolio is based off the [startbootstrap-resume template](https://github.com/startbootstrap/startbootstrap-resume) (which continues to makes up most of the code found within this repository). For completeness, I highlight below one small area that I changed.

### Changes
Apart from the obvious updates made such as personal information, the **Awards** section was replaced with a **Projects** section. As a budding developer, projects were a lot more relevant and admittedly easier for sharing what I have or are working on.

### Setup
Please refer to the original project's [README](https://github.com/startbootstrap/startbootstrap-resume#readme) if you wish to setup a portfolio based off the same template. If like me, you wish to use a **Projects** section instead of an **Awards** section, you may also follow the same setup instructions for this repository.

If you have code to contribute, open a pull request and describe clearly the changes and what they are intended to do (enhancement, bug fixes etc). Alternatively, you may simply raise bugs or suggestions by opening an issue.

**Note:** You may also wish to make a pull request to the [original repository](https://github.com/startbootstrap/startbootstrap-resume) if your changes are general enough to benefit everyone.
